Once the Young Church-Service Missionary Recommendation Form has been completed, including the signatures of the applicant and parent or guardian on page 3, the prospective young Church-service missionary should meet with his or her bishop for a worthiness interview and to discuss his or her specific abilities and limitations. When the bishop has approved the application, the prospective young Church-service missionary (YCSM) meets with the stake president for a worthiness interview. The stake president should work with the local Church-service missionary group coordinators to craft a mission specific to the young Church-service missionary so that it fits the applicant’s skills and abilities. The Church-Service missionary group coordinators process the YCSM’s mission call. 
For those who live in Utah between Payson and the Idaho border, this form should be submittedby the stake president to the young Church-service missionary coordinators in the Church OfficeBuilding, who will work with the stake president to find appropriate service opportunities forthe young Church-service missionary. This form can be faxed to 1-801-240-1726 or scannedand emailed to ycsm@ldschurch.org. For further clarification or assistance, please call1-801-240-4914.
