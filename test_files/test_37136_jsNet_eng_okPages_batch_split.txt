WHY NETWORK? 
A “network” consists of people you know and the people they know. When you talk to people you know about your job search, find out who they know who can also help you with your job search. This is “networking.” 
Networking is the most effective way to find a job; approximately 70 percent of all jobs are found this way. In addition, it allows you to find out about jobs that are never advertised—the “hidden job market,” which accounts for 80 percent of all available jobs. Networking can also help you identify or find financing for self-employment or educational pursuits. 
Through networking you develop the ability to build and maintain relationships with a variety of people. This skill is fundamental not only to a successful job search but to your overall job success. 
The Career Workshop, available through the LDS employment resource center or your stake employment specialist, will help you to develop the skills necessary to effectively create and build a networking plan. 
METHODS 
The word work is part of networking. It is not easy work because it challenges you to reach outside your comfort zone. Besides meeting in person, use other effective methods of communication, such as letters, notes, clippings, and other positive interactions. Any honest effort can yield positive results. 
Who is Most Helpful in Building a Network? 
Begin networking with the people you know—family, friends, neighbors, church groups, social groups, volunteer organizations—and build your network to include: 
•	People who know something about your chosen 
career. 
•	
People who know others who have influence. 

•	
People who know a lot of other people. 


Remember that to achieve quicker, better results, you should: 
•	
Contact at least 10 people or resources per day. 

•	
Get 2 new referrals from each contact. 

•	
Set up at least 2 face-to-face meetings or interviews 


each day. 
GUIDELINES 
It takes practice to learn how to network well. The best way to learn is by role-playing in a small group or workshop. It may take a while to feel comfortable. Here are some guidelines that can help you: 
•	Before meeting with someone, determine what you 
want to find out or accomplish. 

“All have not every gift given unto them.…To some is given one,and to some is given another, that all may be profited thereby.” 
DOCTRINE AND COVENANTS 46:11–12

mistake of trying to “sell” yourself prematurely. Those who are most successful establish a rapport first. Don’t rush it.

to follow up. If you say you will call someone, do it soon after your conversation.

others about your job search? 
•	Always send a thank-you note. 

•	When meeting someone for the first time, be sure to introduce yourself. Use a “Me in 30 Seconds” statement (described at www.ldsjobs.org and in the Career Workshop). 
•	Ask those you meet with about themselves,and then listen. Ask about their work, how they got into their field, what they like about it, what is challenging, and so on. Remember that they may be networking too. Share information you have that may be useful to them. 
•	Briefly describe what you are seeking and how you are qualified. Use a “Power Statement” (described at www.ldsjobs.org and in the Career Workshop). 
•	When appropriate (usually at the end of your conversation), exchange business cards and the names of other people you should contact.

“I contacted a friend who had influence inside a big company, and he arranged an interview for a job opening. I used the skills I learned in the Career Workshop, and I am now a grateful employee.” 
São Paulo, Brazil 
“After the Career Workshop, I began [contacting businesses directly], applying the knowledge and techniques I learned. I made eight calls. Four businesses asked me to leave my information. I obtained two interviews and received job offers from each after the interview. I chose the job where I did not work on Sunday.”
