“Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York,stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in theneighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, undera stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. Thisstone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above theground, but the edge all around was covered with earth.
“Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed underthe edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in,and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they laywas formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on thesestones lay the plates and the other things with them.
“I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messenger, and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth hadnot yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but hetold me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from thattime, and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.
“Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year,and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting whatthe Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom wasto be conducted in the last days. . . .
“At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim andThummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usualat the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, thesame heavenly messenger delivered them up to me with this charge: thatI should be responsible for them; that if I should let them go carelessly,or through any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I woulduse all my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, shouldcall for them, they should be protected.
“I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges tokeep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when Ihad done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For nosooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be inventedwas resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitterand severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually toget them from me if possible. But by the wisdom of God, they remainedsafe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was requiredat my hand. When, according to arrangements, the messenger called forthem, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge untilthis day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred andthirty-eight.”

The ancient record thus brought forth from the earth as the voice of apeople speaking from the dust, and translated into modern speech by thegift and power of God as attested by Divine affirmation, was first published to the world in the year 1830 as The Book of Mormon.
